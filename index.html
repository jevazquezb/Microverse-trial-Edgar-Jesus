    Hello Camper!

    For now, the test suite only works in Chrome!
    Please read the README below in the JS Editor before beginning.
    Feel free to delete this message once you have read it.
    Good luck and Happy Coding!

        Javascript
      </header>
      <p><code>JavaScript (JS)</code> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
        functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
        also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
        programming) styles.</p>
      <p>The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older
        browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version
        of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6.
        Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft
        version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
      <header>
        Syntax
      </header>
      <p><code>Syntax </code>specifies the required combination and sequence of characters making up correctly structured code.
        Syntax generally includes grammar and the rules that apply to writing it, such as indentation requirements in
        Python.</p>
      <p>Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in HTML and JavaScript). Although languages
        can share few similarities in terms of their syntaxes for example "operand operator operand" rule in javaScript
        and python. This does not mean the two languages share similarities with syntax.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_data">
      <header>Types of data</header>
      <p>JavaScript is a <code>loosely typed and dynamic language.</code>Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with
        any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:</p>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines nine types:

        Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:
        <ul>
          <li>
            undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
          </li>
          <li>
            Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
          </li>
          <li>
            Number : typeof instance === "number"
          </li>
          <li>
            String : typeof instance === "string"
          </li>
          <li>
            BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"
          </li>
          <li>
            Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
      <header>Loops</header>
      <p><code>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing</code>>: they repeat an action some
        number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)</p>
      <p>The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are
        various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
      <header>Functions</header>
      <p><code>Functions</code> are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a
        procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a
        function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the
        input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call
        it.</p>
      <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function
        keyword, followed by:

        The name of the function.
        A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.</p>
